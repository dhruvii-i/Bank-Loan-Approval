# 🏦 Bank Loan Approval Prediction

**This project focuses on building a supervised machine learning model to predict whether a bank loan application will be approved based on various applicant details. The goal is to help financial institutions make quicker and more reliable lending decisions using data-driven insights.**

## 📌 Problem Statement

Financial institutions deal with thousands of loan applications daily. Manual approval processes are time-consuming and prone to bias. Automating loan approval using machine learning allows for scalable, fair, and faster decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze the dataset to understand applicant demographics and behavior.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations.
- Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values and categorical variables.
- Build a classification model to predict loan approval.
- Evaluate model performance using suitable metrics.
